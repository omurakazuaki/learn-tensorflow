    "- MaxPooling2D: これもCNNの一部で、画像データの次元を削減し、重要な特徴を保持するために使用されます。これはtf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size)という形で使用されます。ここで、pool_sizeはプーリングウィンドウのサイズを指定します。\n",
    "- Dropout: これは過学習を防ぐためのレイヤーで、訓練中にランダムに入力ユニットをドロップアウト（つまり、0に設定）します。これはtf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate)という形で使用されます。ここで、rateはドロップアウトさせる入力の割合を指定します。\n",
