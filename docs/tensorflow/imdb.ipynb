    "## レイヤー\n",
    "- Dense: これは通常の全結合ニューラルネットワークのレイヤーで、各入力ノードが各出力ノードに接続しています。これはtf.keras.layers.Dense(units, activation)という形で使用されます。ここで、unitsは出力空間の次元（すなわち、レイヤーのニューロン数）を指定し、activationは使用する活性化関数を指定します。\n",
    "- Conv2D: これは畳み込みニューラルネットワーク（CNN）のレイヤーで、画像の局所的な特徴を捉えるために使用されます。これはtf.keras.layers.Conv2D(filters, kernel_size, activation)という形で使用されます。ここで、filtersは出力空間の次元（つまり、畳み込みによって生成されるフィルターの数）、kernel_sizeは畳み込みのウィンドウサイズを指定します。\n",
    "- MaxPooling2D: これもCNNの一部で、画像データの次元を削減し、重要な特徴を保持するために使用されます。これはtf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size)という形で使用されます。ここで、pool_sizeはプーリングウィンドウのサイズを指定します。\n",
    "- Dropout: これは過学習を防ぐためのレイヤーで、訓練中にランダムに入力ユニットをドロップアウト（つまり、0に設定）します。これはtf.keras.layers.Dropout(rate)という形で使用されます。ここで、rateはドロップアウトさせる入力の割合を指定します。\n",
    "- Flatten: これは多次元のテンソルを1次元に変換します。CNNの後に全結合層を追加する前にしばしば使用されます。\n",

    "## 活性化関数\n",
    "- ReLU: 負の入力は0として、0もしくは正の入力はそのまま出力する関数(つまりmax(0, x))\n",
